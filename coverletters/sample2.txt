1. Introduction
My name is Jihoon Lee, and I am a proud graduate of Seoul National University with
a degree in Business Administration. Throughout my academic journey, I developed
a deep interest in marketing, particularly in understanding consumer behavior and
creating impactful campaigns that resonate with diverse audiences. This passion
was ignited during my undergraduate studies when I took a course titled Consumer
Psychology and Marketing Strategies. The course introduced me to the fascinating
world of how brands connect with people on an emotional level, and I realized that
marketing is not just about promoting products but about building meaningful
relationships with consumers.
What I value most in both my personal and professional life are creativity,
collaboration, and integrity. I believe that these values are the foundation for driving
innovation and achieving sustainable success in any field. My vision is to contribute
to the marketing industry by creating campaigns that not only drive business growth
but also inspire positive change in society.
In terms of personality, my greatest strengths include adaptability, analytical thinking,
and strong interpersonal skills. These traits have allowed me to thrive in dynamic
environments and effectively collaborate with teams from diverse backgrounds.
However, I am also aware of my tendency to be overly detail-oriented at times, which
can slow down decision-making processes. To address this, I have been working on
prioritizing tasks and setting clear deadlines to maintain efficiency without
compromising quality.
2. Motivation for Application
I am highly motivated to apply for the marketing position at Samsung Electronics, a
company renowned for its innovative approach to branding and its commitment to
delivering exceptional value to customers. What particularly draws me to Samsung
Electronics is its emphasis on digital transformation and customer-centric strategies,
which align perfectly with my own professional aspirations.
My interest in Samsung Electronics began when I came across its groundbreaking
campaign for the Galaxy Z Fold series. The campaign’s ability to connect with
consumers on both an emotional and practical level left a lasting impression on me.
It demonstrated the power of strategic marketing in shaping perceptions and driving
engagement—a skill set that I am eager to further develop under the guidance of
industry leaders at Samsung Electronics.
The reason I am applying for this role is not only because of my passion for
marketing but also because of my belief that Samsung Electronics provides an
environment where creativity and innovation thrive. With my academic background in
business administration and hands-on experience in marketing projects, I am
confident that I can contribute fresh perspectives and strategic insights to your team.
One of my strongest skills is data-driven decision-making. During my time at Seoul
National University, I gained proficiency in analyzing market trends using tools such
as Google Analytics and Tableau. Additionally, my experience in managing social
media campaigns has honed my ability to create content that resonates with target
audiences while achieving measurable results. These skills, combined with my
enthusiasm for continuous learning, make me well-equipped to excel in this role.
3. Relevant Experience
During my time at Seoul National University, I actively sought opportunities to apply
theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios through various projects, competitions,
and extracurricular activities. One of the most impactful experiences was leading a
team for the Korea Marketing Challenge, a nationwide competition where we were
tasked with developing a comprehensive marketing strategy for a new product
launch by LG Household & Health Care. Our team focused on targeting millennials
through digital platforms and created an innovative campaign centered around the
theme of “Self-Care Revolution”, which emphasized wellness products tailored for
busy lifestyles.
As the team leader, I was responsible for conducting market research, analyzing
consumer data, and coordinating tasks among team members. One significant
challenge we faced was limited access to detailed market data due to confidentiality
restrictions. To overcome this obstacle, we utilized publicly available resources such
as industry reports and conducted surveys to gather primary data from our target
audience. By leveraging these insights, we successfully presented a strategy that
earned us second place in the competition.
Additionally, I participated in an internship at Coupang, where I worked as a
marketing assistant for six months. During this internship, I was involved in planning
and executing social media campaigns for Coupang Eats, focusing on increasing
brand awareness among college students. One memorable project was managing
the Instagram account for the “Campus Eats” campaign, where I increased follower
engagement by 30% within three months through creative content creation and
strategic hashtag usage. This experience taught me the importance of staying
updated on digital trends and continuously adapting strategies based on audience
feedback.
Beyond academic projects and internships, I also volunteered as a marketing
coordinator for Habitat Korea, where I organized promotional activities for fundraising
events aimed at supporting underprivileged communities. One key takeaway from
this experience was learning how to balance budget constraints while maximizing
outreach—a skill that is highly relevant for any marketing role.
Through these experiences, I have developed a strong foundation in market
research, campaign planning, content creation, and performance analysis—all
essential skills for succeeding in the dynamic field of marketing.
4. Career Aspirations
Joining Samsung Electronics represents an exciting opportunity for me to grow as a
marketing professional while contributing to meaningful projects that drive business
success and societal impact. My immediate goal upon joining your team is to
immerse myself in understanding your brand’s unique identity and customer base so
that I can contribute effectively to ongoing campaigns.
In terms of professional development, I aim to deepen my expertise in digital
marketing strategies by leveraging cutting-edge tools such as AI-powered analytics
platforms like Adobe Sensei or Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Additionally, I hope to
collaborate with colleagues across departments to gain insights into integrated
marketing approaches that combine traditional methods with innovative
technologies.
Looking ahead, my long-term career aspiration is to become a global marketing
strategist who leads campaigns across multiple regions while maintaining cultural
sensitivity and relevance. Specifically, I envision myself spearheading initiatives that
promote Samsung’s commitment to sustainability by highlighting eco-friendly product
lines or advocating for digital inclusivity through accessible technologies.
Ultimately, my vision is to create campaigns that inspire positive change—whether
it’s promoting sustainability through eco-friendly products or fostering inclusivity
through thoughtful messaging. By aligning my personal values with professional
goals, I am committed to making meaningful contributions that benefit both your
organization and society as a whole.
