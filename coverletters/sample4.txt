Relevant Experience
During my time at Seoul National University, I participated in several projects and activities
that significantly developed my software engineering capabilities. In my junior year, I led a
team of four students in the National Software Competition sponsored by the Ministry of
Science and ICT, where we developed "EcoTrack,
" a platform for monitoring and analyzing
urban environmental data. Our solution combined IoT sensor integration with data
visualization techniques, earning us second place among 87 competing teams nationwide.
A particularly formative experience was my participation in the university's Undergraduate
Research Program, where I worked with Professor Kim on optimizing database query
performance for large-scale genomic data analysis. This project introduced me to the
challenges of handling datasets exceeding several terabytes while maintaining acceptable
query response times. I implemented partitioning strategies and custom indexing techniques
that reduced average query times from minutes to seconds, enabling researchers to perform
complex analyses more efficiently.
The most challenging project I undertook was developing a distributed file system for my
capstone course. Our four-person team aimed to create a fault-tolerant storage system
capable of handling simultaneous read/write operations across multiple nodes. Midway
through development, we encountered a critical issue where write operations would
occasionally corrupt data during node synchronization. After identifying the problem, I spent
three days analyzing the synchronization protocol and discovered a race condition in our
implementation.
To resolve this issue, I redesigned our consistency mechanism using a two-phase commit
protocol and implemented comprehensive logging to track operation sequences. I created
detailed test scenarios that could reliably reproduce the issue, allowing us to verify our
solution's effectiveness. This methodical approach not only fixed the immediate problem but
also improved our system's overall reliability. The experience taught me the importance of
thorough design when developing distributed systems and the value of systematic
debugging approaches when facing complex concurrency issues.
This project particularly relates to the backend developer position at Naver Cloud, where
