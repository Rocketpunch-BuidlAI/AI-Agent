Strengths and Weaknesses:
I consider myself highly organized, detail-oriented, and adaptable—qualities that
allow me to excel in dynamic environments and manage complex tasks efficiently.
My ability to analyze problems critically and propose effective solutions has been
honed through years of academic training and practical experience. On the other
hand, I tend to be overly self-critical at times, which can lead to unnecessary stress.
However, I am actively working on this by focusing on constructive feedback and
celebrating achievements as milestones for growth.

and PyTorch, which are essential for developing scalable AI solutions.
3. Relevant Experience
Academic Projects:
During my undergraduate studies at Stanford University, I led several projects that
allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings. One notable project
was "Predicting Heart Disease Risk Using Machine Learning," where we developed
a predictive model using patient data from public healthcare datasets like MIMIC-III.
This involved extensive data preprocessing using Pandas libraries, model training
using scikit-learn frameworks, and evaluation through cross-validation techniques.
Through this experience, I honed my skills in critical thinking, teamwork, and
effective communication—all essential qualities for success in professional
environments.
Another significant project was focused on "Optimizing Supply Chain Logistics Using
Reinforcement Learning." In this initiative, we tackled challenges related to delivery
route optimization by designing algorithms based on Q-learning methodologies
combined with neural networks for improved decision-making accuracy. This
experience deepened my understanding of reinforcement learning while reinforcing
my ability to manage deadlines and prioritize tasks effectively.
Competitions:
I participated in several competitions during my academic journey that allowed me to
showcase my skills under pressure. For example, at the Kaggle Data Science
Competition 2023 focused on "Predicting Customer Churn," my team secured 2nd
place for our innovative approach using ensemble methods like Random Forests
combined with Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs). This experience taught me
valuable lessons about perseverance, strategic thinking, and collaboration under
tight deadlines.
Another competition that stands out is the ACM Hackathon 2022 held at MIT, where
we presented a solution for "Real-Time Disaster Relief Coordination Using AI." Our
work was recognized for its originality and practicality by industry experts attending
the event.
Extracurricular Activities:
As a leadership member of Stanford’s AI Club (2021–2023), I helped organize
technical workshops, speaker events with industry researchers, and student
participation in international conferences. These experiences enhanced my ability to
coordinate across diverse teams, manage logistics under pressure, and lead
initiatives that delivered measurable impact—skills I continue to refine through
ongoing collaboration.
I also volunteered at a local community center, teaching basic coding to underserved
youth. This role deepened my sense of purpose, reinforcing how empathy and
teamwork can empower others and extend the value of STEM education beyond the
classroom.
Problem-Solving Example:
During a group project, we encountered unexpected technical issues while
integrating third-party APIs essential for seamless application functionality. The
timeline was at serious risk. Recognizing the urgency, I took the initiative to research
alternative approaches, consult experts in my network, and divide the remaining
tasks based on each team member's strengths. Thanks to this proactive strategy, we
completed the integration ahead of schedule—an experience that reinforced the
importance of agile thinking, role-based tasking, and team trust under pressure..
