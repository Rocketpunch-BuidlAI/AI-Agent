I am Park Ji-won, a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration
specializing in Human Resource Management from Nanyang Technological University in
Singapore. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in organizational
behavior, talent acquisition, performance management, and employment law, particularly
within the Singaporean context.
My interest in human resources began during my second year at university when I
volunteered to coordinate recruitment for our Korean Student Association. What started as a
simple administrative task evolved into a fascinating experience of matching people's unique
strengths with appropriate roles. I observed how proper placement significantly improved
both individual satisfaction and team performance. This experience inspired me to pursue
HR courses, where I discovered the strategic impact that effective human resource
management can have on organizational success. During my internship at a multinational
corporation in Singapore, I witnessed firsthand how thoughtful HR policies could create an
inclusive workplace culture that empowered employees across diverse backgrounds.
In my professional approach, I value transparency, equity, and continuous development. I
believe that transparent communication builds trust between management and employees,
while equitable practices ensure everyone has fair opportunities to contribute and grow. I
envision helping organizations build sustainable talent ecosystems where business
objectives align naturally with employee development goals. In today's rapidly evolving
workplace, I'm committed to balancing traditional HR foundations with innovative approaches
that address changing workforce expectations, particularly regarding flexibility,
purpose-driven work, and mental wellbeing.
My greatest strength is my empathetic communication style, which allows me to understand
underlying concerns and mediate effectively between different perspectives. This trait has
consistently helped me build rapport with diverse individuals and resolve interpersonal
conflicts during group projects and community initiatives. My peers often comment on my
ability to remain calm and objective when tensions arise, focusing on finding constructive
solutions rather than assigning blame. However, this same empathetic tendency sometimes
leads me to hesitate when delivering constructive criticism. I have been actively working to
improve this area by practicing more direct communication techniques while maintaining
sensitivity. I've learned that timely, clear feedback ultimately serves everyone better than
delayed or diluted messages, no matter how well-intentioned the hesitation might be.
Through deliberate practice during my final year group projects and internship, I've made
significant progress in balancing empathy with necessary directness.
What I seek in a company is a values-driven approach to people and culture—and Horizon
Global Solutions clearly embodies that. Your recognition as one of Singapore's "Best
Workplaces in Technology" reflects a workplace where psychological safety and innovation
are prioritized. This strongly aligns with my belief that HR should be a strategic enabler, not
just an administrative function. I was especially inspired by your CEO’s recent interview
describing how the company navigated market challenges through transparency and
investment in employee upskilling, rather than layoffs. This kind of long-term,
people-centered leadership is precisely the environment where I hope to grow and
contribute.
Motivation to apply
My interest in your company deepened after attending your HR Innovations Workshop
during the APAC HR Technology Conference last year. The presentation on your
implementation of data-driven retention strategies showcased how you've successfully
balanced technological advancement with human-centered practices. As someone who has
conducted university research on predictive analytics in talent management, I was inspired
by how your HR team translates complex workforce data into meaningful interventions that
address real employee needs. This practical application of HR analytics represents exactly
the kind of forward-thinking environment where I believe I could both contribute significantly
and continue my professional growth.
I am applying for the People Operations Manager position because it represents an ideal
intersection of my academic background in HR management, my interpersonal strengths,
and my passion for creating equitable workplace systems. The role's focus on streamlining
onboarding processes while enhancing employee engagement presents challenges I'm
eager to address. Having redesigned the orientation program during my internship at
TechVision Asia, resulting in a 27% improvement in new hire satisfaction scores, I
understand the impact that thoughtful people operations can have on organizational
performance.
My strongest assets for this position include my cross-cultural communication skills,
developed through facilitating dialogues between international student groups, and my
experience with HRIS platforms including Workday and SAP SuccessFactors. I bring a
unique combination of analytical rigor and emotional intelligence that allows me to implement
data-informed HR solutions while maintaining the human connection essential to effective
people management. My bilingual fluency in English and Korean would also be valuable in
supporting your company's expanding APAC operations and diverse workforce.
Relevant work experiences
During my tenure at Nanyang Technological University, I led a comprehensive restructuring
of the Korean Student Association's recruitment process, transforming it from an informal,
connection-based system to a structured competency-based approach. As Talent Acquisition
Coordinator, I implemented standardized application forms, developed skills assessment
activities, and created a blind review process to minimize unconscious bias. This initiative
increased membership diversity by 35% and improved retention rates by identifying
candidates whose values aligned with our organization's mission. The experience taught me
the importance of implementing fair selection processes—a principle I would apply when
refining recruitment protocols at Horizon Global Solutions.
My most significant HR-related achievement came during my internship at TechVision Asia,
where I assisted in resolving a critical onboarding bottleneck. The company was
experiencing rapid growth with 20-30 new hires monthly, but satisfaction surveys revealed
dissatisfaction with the orientation process. Identifying the issue as information overload, I
developed a phased onboarding approach that spread training across four weeks rather than
overwhelming new employees in their first days. Working cross-functionally with IT and
department managers, I created role-specific learning paths and implemented digital
check-in points to track progress. This redesigned program reduced information retention
issues by 42% and improved new hire satisfaction scores from 3.2 to 4.1 out of 5.
I encountered significant resistance when first proposing these changes. The HR Director
was concerned about extending the onboarding timeline when teams needed resources
quickly. Rather than abandoning the idea, I gathered evidence from exit interviews showing
that inadequate onboarding led to higher early turnover. I then conducted a small pilot with
five new hires, documenting their improved performance metrics compared to previous
cohorts. This data-driven approach convinced stakeholders to implement the program
company-wide, teaching me the value of using metrics to drive organizational change—a
skill I would leverage in your data-centric approach to people operations.
Additionally, I developed practical experience with conflict resolution while mediating a
disagreement between international student groups over limited university resources. By
creating a transparent allocation system based on measurable impact metrics rather than
historical precedent, I helped establish trust between diverse stakeholders. This experience
strengthened my belief that HR professionals must simultaneously advocate for employees
while aligning with organizational constraints—a balance I'm prepared to maintain as your
People Operations Manager.
Ambition and goals
As a prospective People Operations Manager at Horizon Global Solutions, my immediate
goal is to become a catalyst for building stronger connections between HR initiatives and
measurable business outcomes. Within my first year, I aim to master your company's unique
culture and operational workflows, while introducing data-driven improvements to the
employee lifecycle management process. Specifically, I intend to develop expertise in your
HRIS systems to identify opportunities for process optimization and create more meaningful
analytics that inform strategic workforce decisions. By leveraging my academic background
in HR analytics and building on it with practical application in your environment, I aspire to
transform routine people operations into strategic advantages that support Horizon's
continued growth in the APAC market.
I am particularly excited to contribute to your company's wellbeing and inclusion initiatives.
Drawing on my cross-cultural communication skills and experience mediating between
diverse stakeholder groups, I hope to enhance your existing DEI framework by implementing
more personalized approaches to employee engagement. One of my first projects would be
developing culture-specific onboarding journeys that honor the diverse backgrounds of your
international workforce while ensuring consistent transmission of company values. I believe
this approach could further strengthen Horizon's reputation as an employer of choice in
Singapore's competitive talent market.
Looking ahead to my long-term career trajectory, I envision growing into a People & Culture
leadership role where I can influence organizational strategy at a broader level. I am
passionate about the evolving relationship between technology and human capital
management, and aspire to become an authority on maintaining the human element in
increasingly digital workplaces. Within five years, I aim to develop specialized expertise in
change management and organizational development, potentially leading transformation
initiatives as Horizon Global Solutions continues to expand throughout Asia. My ultimate
career goal is to become a Chief People Officer who champions evidence-based HR
practices while maintaining unwavering commitment to employee wellbeing and
organizational ethics.
I believe Horizon Global Solutions is the ideal environment for this professional journey,
offering both the innovative spirit to support my growth aspirations and the established
infrastructure to provide meaningful learning opportunities in global HR management.
